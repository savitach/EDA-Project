**Data Analysis With Python**

**EDA Over IIT Admission**

**Overview:**
The main aim of EDA is to “Analyze the datasets to summarize their characteristics with visual methods”. In this project IIT Admission Dataset  provides valuable information about 200,000 students who have applied for admissions to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). The dataset has been summarized with their characteristics such as  field of study, specialization, fees, and discounts offered to the students and visualized with various plots .The visualization enables in-depth analysis of IIT admission trends .Based on this analysis researchers, educational institutions and policymakers can utilize to gain a better understanding of the IIT admissions process and make informed decisions.

**Programming language: Python**
**Libraries: Pandas,NumPy, Seaborn, matplotlib.**

**Conclusion:**
From our analysis of the Admissions at IIT, we can see that there is a even spread between all the students in relatively all of the fields of our data. The fees and discounts were stable among each of the different options as well as there being a stable spread between the fees between each of the different fields. This concludes the exploratory data analysis of IIT admissions.
